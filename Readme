Task- Analyzing the captured Network traffic using Wireshark Tool.
Tools- Wireshark, Cmd Prompt.
Procedure
Step-1: Opened Wireshark application and double clicked on WIfI as I am connected to the Wireless Network.
Step-2: Capture of packets in the Network started.
Step-3: Opened Chrome and search for website www.chatgpt.com
Step-4: Tried to ping the chatgpt website in Cmd Prompt.
Step-5: Stopped the network packet capture.
Step-6: Saved the capture with Name Packet Capture with file extension .pcap as an evidence.
Step-7: Checked for the protocols captured within this session.

Protocols I choose to analyze:
1) Http: Helps to see which websites or servers the client accessed and the response received from Server.
2) ICMP: To check for the latency in the response and identify reasons for unreachable hosts.
3) DNS: To see which websites or servers were visited.

Observation:
- When I tried to ping the Website, ICMP packet was captured by the Wireshark Network Analyzer, which shows the footprint.
- The main protocol in every network has DNS, where in it provided me the source and destination address for which the packet was sent.
- When I searched in chrome, I found http packet with HTTP Response 200 OK Success, where in the server responded for the GET Request packet.
